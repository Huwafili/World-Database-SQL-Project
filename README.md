# 🌎 World Dataset Exploration 📂

Welcome to the **World Dataset Exploration** project! 🌟 In this project, I dive into a rich global information dataset and analyze it using **SQL**. Additionally, I design and documented the data relationships with an **Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagram**. Let's uncover the world’s data story together! 🌐

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL**: 🔍 Querying, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset.  
- **EER Diagram**: 🎨 Visualizing database relationships and structures for better understanding.
